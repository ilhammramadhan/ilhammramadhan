# Hey there 👋

I'm Ilham, a software developer based in Malang, Indonesia.

I mostly work on full-stack development — React, TypeScript, and Java Spring Boot on the backend.

I also build mobile apps with React Native and Expo when the project calls for it.

Currently working at **MGG Software** and pursuing my CS degree at BINUS University. Everything here is built from real projects and experiments.
